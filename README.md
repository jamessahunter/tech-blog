 This project allows the user to create posts consisting of a title and some content. The user can see all posts created and comment on them. The user can also see all posts they have written as well as the option to update or delete posts. In order for the user to interact with any posts they must be logged in to the site. If the user trys to interact and they are not signed in the user is taken to the login page where they can either log in or click to sign up. This project taught me how to use the model view controller method for dynamically update sites. This is mainly done through the use of express handlebars. This project uses sequalize whcih allows for the code to be written in a more readable way rather than typing out the raw SQL for that action. Also this project uses Object Relational Mapping to assist in the creation of tables and their entries in the database. This project also uses the dotenv package which allows the programmer to hide potentially sensitive information. Mysql2 hosts the server that the user is interacting with.
